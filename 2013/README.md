# Functional Reactive Programming in Elm

This is the talk from StrangeLoop 2013.

Much of the actual content of this talk was presented by live coding,
so this presentation really needs the corresponding video to make sense.
This will go online sometime in the next few months.

In any case, the actual Prezi is online
[here](http://prezi.com/t11kfw3spozs/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share)
and will be nicer to read than the PDF.
